                Your data is stored securely using encrypted databases in reliable, globally distributed data centers
                with industry-grade uptime and protection standards. We use MySQL for secure, scalable, and efficient
                information management. All access is governed by strict internal policies, allowing only authorized
                personnel to interact with sensitive systems. Additionally, sensitive data like passwords are never
                stored in plain text—we apply one-way hashing using secure algorithms to protect user credentials from
                exposure. Our systems are routinely monitored and updated to comply with evolving security standards.

                You have complete control over your personal information. At any time, you can manage your account
                settings, update contact preferences, change or recover login credentials, and request data export or
                deletion in accordance with data protection laws. We are committed to transparency and empower our users
                with tools and support to safeguard their privacy. Whether it's updating your profile or removing your
                account, our team ensures every request is handled securely and promptly. Your trust is essential to us,

                We implement strong security measures including end-to-end encryption, hashed passwords, secure server
                configurations, and access control policies. All sensitive information is stored in encrypted databases,
                and our infrastructure is continuously monitored for unusual activity or threats. Regular security
                audits, software updates, and vulnerability scans help us stay ahead of potential risks. Your privacy
                and data integrity are our top priorities, and we are committed to protecting them at every level of our

                Protecting children’s privacy is very important to us. We do not knowingly collect or store personal
                information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that such data has been provided, we
                promptly delete it from our systems. We strongly encourage parents and guardians to monitor and guide
                their children's use of online services, especially when it involves sharing personal details or making
                purchases.

                We process your personal data based on your clear consent, the necessity to fulfill a contract (such as
                processing your orders), or to comply with legal requirements like fraud prevention and tax reporting.
                In some cases, we also rely on our legitimate interest to improve services and ensure security. You
                always have the right to withdraw consent, update your communication preferences, or object to certain
                types of data use.
